As a senior data analyst, I have access to data from a recent animal study involving 249 mice with SCC tumors, treated with various drug regimens over 45 days. The goal was to evaluate the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug, Capomulin, against other treatments.  Iâ€™m tasked with creating all the tables and figures for the technical report and providing a top-level summary of the study results.


    This project is broken down into the following tasks:
      Prepare the data.
      Generate summary statistics.
      Create bar charts and pie charts.
      Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
      Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
      Calculate correlation and regression.
      Submit your final analysis.
